# Holiday-App-Project
OSU CS Capstone Project


Project Description:
The Holiday App is developed as a project and collaboration between Oregon State University students and The Christmas Tree Promotion Board which is sanctioned by the United States Department of Agriculture via their established commodity check-off system.

During the last 6 months since the beginning of the project, the application has evolved from a basic informational page into a fully-featured unique product that offers the ability for the user to use augmented reality to place a virtual tree in a physical space through the use of phone camera and adjust the size of the tree in real-time. 

The application also provides a real-time map of Tree Lot locations around the user to provide navigation to the nearest lot in order to make a purchase. In combination, these two tools offer an unparalleled level of convenience to simplify the purchase of authentic Christmas Trees.

Development Details:
Release Platform: iOS

Language: Swift, Objective-C

Frameworks: UIKit, SwiftUI, ARKit, RealityKit

Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Xcode

How to open the project:

Summary:
While the core functionality of the application is complete, further development and testing are required in order to release a stable and robust utility.

With continued further development, the application should be ready to debut by Holiday Season 2021.
