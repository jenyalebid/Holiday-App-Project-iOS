# Holiday-App-Project
OSU CS Capstone Project

The Holiday App is an iOS application that assists users on buying Christmas trees by locating nearby tree lots. This is done by providing a locator on our application which allows users to obtain information from the lots, as well as directions to get there. Our application is supplemented with other great features such as AR which helps users determine the perfect height that they need to purchase their Christmas tree at. Our intent with our application is to help bring awareness to these small lots, and to get users involved with these lots, and keep the holiday spirit alive.
